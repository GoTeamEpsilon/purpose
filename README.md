# TeamEpsilon

## Purpose

We are a small open source development group working on interesting projects that serve as educational resources as well as provide value to existing open source projects.

## Current Project

- [Angular to React](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/angular-to-react) (_A playground repository that will be filled with educational resources and live code as our dev group (Angular experts) learns React/Redux by contrasting it to Angular concepts._)

## Upcoming Projects

- OpenEMR Cloud (_A project that will demonstrate how a small facility or large hospital system can run their OpenEMR installation in the cloud via AWS Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, VPC, and other more essential services. AWS cloud will provide a performant, highly scalable, deeply secure, and cost-effective choice for many global OpenEMR users._) Note that the follow script can be used for inspiration: https://sourceforge.net/p/openemr/discussion/202506/thread/a3727d02/

- Filling in documentation gaps for Socket.io SO wiki (http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/socket.io/topics).

- Contributions to the new and high-impact [React Blueprint project](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/blueprint).
