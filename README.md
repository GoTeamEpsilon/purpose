# TeamEpsilon

## Purpose

We are an open source development group working on interesting projects that serve as educational resources as well as provide value.

## Current Project

- [Angular to React](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/angular-to-react) (_A playground repository that will be filled with educational resources and live code as our dev group (Angular experts) learns React/Redux by contrasting it to Angular concepts._)

## Upcoming Projects

- OpenEMR Cloud (_A project that will demonstrate how a small facility or large hospital system can run their OpenEMR installation in the cloud via AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS RDS, AWS VPC, and may more essential services. AWS cloud will provide a secure, highly scalable, and deeply secure, and cost-effective choice for many global OpenEMR users._)

- Contributions to the new and high-impact [React Blueprint project](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/blueprint).
