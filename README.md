## Purpose

We are a small open source development group working on interesting projects that serve as educational resources as well as provide value to existing open source projects.

## Current Project

## Potential Future Projects
- Testing, documenting, and improving https://github.com/MohawkMEDIC/client-registry for production use.
- Testing out/integrating low cost medical devices for OpenEMR (useful for developing country users).
- Changing https://github.com/MatthewVita/fake-patient-web/issues/1 to store enhanced NAMCS data, translate it to FHIR resources, and serve it up via a FHIR server.
- Nice markdown to Mediawiki editor for Wikipedia.
